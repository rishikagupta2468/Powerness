## About Image Recognition Directories and Files
- Original_dataset:
It contains images folder which contains around 13000 images of people which we have used in our face recognition model training.

- Face Recognition:
It conatins:
  - Data preparation + Recognition.ipynb : Which contains code  for data preparation and face recognition. Initially we are considering 3000 images out of 13000 images. This code works for both real time face recognition and face recognition in images. We have used KNN algorithm in this.
  
  - Files : This folder contains numpy arrays of images which we use in face recognition.
 
  - Recognition.py : It is pyhton script to perform face recognition using command line or terminal.
  
  - haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml : It is haarcascade classifier used to detect facial features in face recognition.
